# Installing command line tools for XCode in old macOS without XCode

## The case

Setup fails for our old MacBook Air (Late 2015) at the stage "You need to install XCode and you have not enough disk space for that". Pity.

## Solution

Luckily, Apple keeps the support forums running and [the solution is there](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2339/_index.html).

Try and error way leads to one usable result: Command Line Tools for XCode 13.4 are compatible with macOS 12.6.6.

Fin.
